<h1> Speed Trivia Game! </h1>
<p> Description: THe idea with this app is that you are able to see how much trivia you really know, by answering questions on any category and see whether you know it or not. After you finish the quiz, the app tells you your score, the time it took, displays all the questions you got right and wrong, and provides and button that allows you to immediately search it up on google. </p>

<p> Technologies Used: Android Studios, <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php"> Trivia API </a> </p>

<p> Android Studios was definitely a pain to learn. Thankfully, there were so many youtube videos that saved me and taught me a bunch of stuff, such as using buttons, listview, adapters, spinners, linearlayout, relativelayout, etc. </p>
